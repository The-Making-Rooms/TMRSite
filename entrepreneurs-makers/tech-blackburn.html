Blackburn and the North-West has a rich history of technological innovation, which has seen a resurgence in recent years, with Manchester playing host to the UK’s first rapid prototyping Fab Lab, to Blackburn now being home to the best quipped Fab Lab nationwide.

<br><br>

“I would definitely recommend this to new makers…or just someone with an idea they have. Tech Blackburn is a great way to try out new ideas, gain confidence in product ideas, learn design skills and make connections with other makers, plus have the opportunity to practice using equipment to make quality prototypes or even finished products.”
<br><br>
-Norma Foulds, TECH BLACKBURN alumni
<br>
We are seeing a societal shift towards inventive startups and entrepreneurship and away from the standard 9-5 desk jobs. Startups are perfectly positioned to react quickly to market opportunities as the rate of technological advancement increases and customers demand a more transparent, ethical, and personal connection to the brands they purchase from.

<br><br>

Starting a business and creating a product has never been easier. With the advent of free social media marketing and crowd funding platforms to sell new product lines, coupled with cheap rapid prototyping that 3D printers and other new technologies offer, anyone with a good idea and a lot of determination can start a successful innovative company.
<br><br>
To make it easier for people in Blackburn and the North-West to develop new technologies, The Making Rooms has paired up with local organisations to deliver Blackburn’s first technology startup accelerator.
<br><br>
On the programme, you will meet Katherine, our marketing expert who has years of experience helping big or small businesses find a suitable strategy that would work for them. She does this with a step by step guide that she has developed called “themarketingknot“. She knows that for a business to be successful with its marketing it’s all about creating a structure and system that will serve you year after year (no matter how big your business becomes) and helps you build the business you’ve always wanted to build. Because ultimately that’s what it’s all about. You.
