The Ultimaker 2+ desktop 3D printers print layer by layer with a very thin bead of molten plastic, similar in concept to a hot glue gun.
<br><br>
They can print complex 3D objects up to 230 x 225 x 205mm 
<br><br>
It appears to be a relatively slow process, especially when compared to the laser cutter or vinyl cutter with even small parts taking upwards of ½ hour to print but compared to other methods of making 3D plastic parts it is extremely rapid.
<br><br>
It is one of the easiest machines in The Making Rooms to use, as long as you have a suitable 3D model file ready prepared.

It has been developed based on the knowledge and experience Ultimaker has gained from the first generation which was invented in Protospace Fab Lab in Utrecht, Netherlands. Every part has been redesigned to create what we consider to be the best and most reliable low-cost 3D printer available on the market. The Ultimaker 2+ uses open source free software and you don’t need any specific technical knowledge to operate it. It has been specially designed for both non-experts and experts.
<br><br>
The resolution goes down to 20 microns (0.02mm) at an accuracy of 12.5 microns in the horizontal axes and 5 microns in the vertical.

Materials
PLA (Polylactic Acid), a biodegradable polymer based on vegetable starch. It come in reels of material similar to garden strimmer wire.
<br><br>
Input files
All 3D printers accept the industry standard .stl files. These are 3D files which can be output from most 3D design or CAD software such as Sketchup, Solidworks, Rhino3D, AutoCAD, Blender and many more.
